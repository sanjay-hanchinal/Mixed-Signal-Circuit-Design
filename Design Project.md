Sample and Hold circuits :

Sample and hold architectures are basic building blocks of the data conversion systems.
Sample and hold circuits are used with ADC to sample input analog signal and hold sampled signals.
These are used at front end of ADC to relax sampling time requirements.
Sampling circuit samples an analog signal and stores the value in a memory element until next sampling instant.
