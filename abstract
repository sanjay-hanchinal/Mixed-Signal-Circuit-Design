This project focuses on the design and analysis of various Sample and Hold (S/H) circuit architectures to evaluate their performance and suitability for different applications.
A Sample and Hold circuit captures an analog signal at a specific instant and maintains it for a defined period, enabling accurate conversion and processing. 
In Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) systems, it is employed at the front-end to relax sampling time constraints and enhance conversion accuracy.
In Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) systems, it serves at the back-end to suppress output glitches and ensure smooth signal transitions. 
Acting as a crucial interface between analog and digital domains, the S/H circuit ensures precise signal acquisition and integrity in mixed-signal systems.
The project emphasizes achieving high precision, speed, and stability, which are critical for efficient performance in modern ADC and DAC applications.
